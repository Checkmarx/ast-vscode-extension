A security issue has been detected in \`${packageName}@${packageVersion}\` (package manager: \`${packageManager}\`).
**Severity:** \`${status}\`
Your task is to remediate the issue **completely and autonomously** using the internal PackageRemediation tool in ${getProductName()} MCP. Follow the exact instructions in \`fix_instructions\` — no assumptions or manual interaction allowed.

---

1. ANALYSIS (AUTOMATED):

Determine the issue type:
- If \`status\` is one of: \`Critical\`, \`High\`, \`Medium\`, \`Low\`, \`Info\`, set: \`issueType = "CVE"\`
- If \`status = "Malicious"\`, set: \`issueType = "malicious"\`

Call the internal PackageRemediation tool with:

\`\`\`json
{
  "packageName": "${packageName}",
  "packageVersion": "${packageVersion}",
  "packageManager": "${packageManager}",
  "issueType": "{determined issueType}"
}
\`\`\`

Parse the response and extract the \`fix_instructions\` field. This field contains the authoritative remediation steps tailored to the ecosystem and risk.

---

2. EXECUTION (AUTOMATED):

- Read and execute each line in \`fix_instructions\`, in order.
- For each change:
  - Apply the instruction exactly.
  - Track all modified files.
  - Note the type of change (e.g., dependency update, import rewrite, API refactor, test fix, TODO insertion).
  - Record before → after values where applicable.
  - Capture line numbers if known.

Examples:
- \`package.json\`: lodash version changed from 3.10.1 → 4.17.21
- \`src/utils/date.ts\`: import updated from \`lodash\` to \`date-fns\`
- \`src/main.ts:42\`: \`_.pluck(users, 'id')\` → \`users.map(u => u.id)\`
- \`src/index.ts:78\`: // TODO: Verify API migration from old-package to new-package

---

3. VERIFICATION:

- If the instructions include build, test, or audit steps — run them exactly as written
- If instructions do not explicitly cover validation, perform basic checks based on \`${packageManager}\`:
  - \`npm\`: \`npx tsc --noEmit\`, \`npm run build\`, \`npm test\`
  - \`go\`: \`go build ./...\`, \`go test ./...\`
  - \`maven\`: \`mvn compile\`, \`mvn test\`
  - \`pypi\`: \`python -c "import ${packageName}"\`, \`pytest\`
  - \`nuget\`: \`dotnet build\`, \`dotnet test\`

If any of these validations fail:
- Attempt to fix the issue if it's obvious
- Otherwise log the error and annotate the code with a TODO

---

### 🔍 Secret Overview

- **Secret Name:** \`${title}\`
- **Severity Level:** \`${severity}\`
- **Details:** ${description}

---

### 🧠 Risk Understanding Based on Severity

- **Critical**:  
  The secret was **validated as active**. It is likely in use and can be exploited immediately if exposed.

- **High**:  
  The validation status is **unknown**. The secret may or may not be valid. Proceed with caution and treat it as potentially live.

- **Medium**:  
  The secret was identified as **invalid** or **mock/test value**. While not active, it may confuse developers or be reused insecurely.

---

### 🔐 Why This Matters

Hardcoded secrets pose a serious risk:
- **Leakage** through public repositories or logs
- **Unauthorized access** to APIs, cloud providers, or infrastructure
- **Exploitation** via replay attacks, privilege escalation, or lateral movement

---

### ✅ Recommended Remediation Steps (for developer action)

- Rotate the secret if it’s live (Critical/High)
- Move secrets to environment variables or secret managers
- Audit the commit history to ensure it hasn’t leaked publicly
- Implement secret scanning in your CI/CD pipelines
- Document safe handling procedures in your repo

---

### 📋 Next Steps Checklist (Markdown)

\`\`\`markdown
### Next Steps:
- [ ] Rotate the exposed secret if valid
- [ ] Move secret to secure storage (.env or secret manager)
- [ ] Clean secret from commit history if leaked
- [ ] Annotate clearly if it's a fake or mock value
- [ ] Implement CI/CD secret scanning and policies
