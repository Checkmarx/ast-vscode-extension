# ast-vscode-extension
# Developer settings
1. Clone project
2. Add the .npmrc token //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=<auth_token>
3. F5 will launch the extension and use breakpoints in ts files for the debugging.
4. Updating to vscode desktop version 1.6x version might not work with current settings. [TODO]
